## WebSocket Listener
Listens for live stock updates from the **Grow a Garden** Roblox game and alerts you when specific items appear.

## What is Grow a Garden?
**Grow a Garden** is a Roblox game where players plant, harvest, and sell crops. This listener connects to its **unofficial WebSocket API** to deliver **real-time inventory alerts** straight to your Mac terminal â€” perfect for serious traders and inventory hoarders.

## Features
- Real-time updates via a WebSocket connection keeps bandwidth to a minimum with low-overhead
- Lightweight by design - just listens via WebSocket, so it reacts instantly without hammering the server
- Configurable keyword alerts
- macOS desktop notifications (`osascript`)
- Weather event display
- Toggle notifications via CLI (`notify=1` or `notify=0`)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- macOS (for notification support)
- Internet connection

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a keywords.txt file and add one item per line (case-insensitive), e.g.:
```
Advanced Sprinkler
Carrot
```

## Running
```bash
./start.sh           # Runs with macOS notifications ON (default)
./start.sh notify=0  # Disable notifications
./start.sh notify=1  # Explicitly enable notifications
```
